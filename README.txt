The “Execution.py” file will answer questions with different types of questions.
1. You need to select an LLM and implement it.
2. You need to select an instruction for TFQ.
3. You need to select a dataset and load the dataset.


After the execution, you can use “mcq_final_selection.py” and “tfq_final_selection.py” to calculate the final selection accuracy.
